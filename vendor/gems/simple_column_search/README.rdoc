= Simple Column Search

Quick and dirty multi column LIKE searches. Great for prototyping auto-completers as it handles partial matches and adding search terms refines the results.

Running lots of queries or have a large data set? You should probably upgrade to a real search back-end already!

== Examples

Add a search method to your model by calling simple_column_search with the fields you want to search.

  class User
    simple_column_search :first_name, :last_name
  end

Search for a single value across all searched columns.

  User.search('eli')             # => anyone with first or last name starting with eli
  User.search('miller')          # => anyone with first or last name starting with miller
  
Refine the search by adding another search term.

  User.search('eli miller')
    # => anyone with first or last name starting with eli AND
    #    anyone with first or last name starting with miller

Specify query match mode. Use :exact, :start, :middle, or :end (default is :start).

  class User
    simple_column_search :name, :match => :exact
  end

Specify query match based on column name.

  class User
    simple_column_search :name, :email, :match => lambda { |column| column == :email ? :middle : :start },
  end

Escape query string before issuing the search request.

  class User
    simple_column_search :name, :escape => lambda { |query| query.gsub(/[^\w\s\-\.']/, '').strip }
  end
